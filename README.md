This project showcases how to analyze stock performance using Python by calculating stock beta and expected returns through the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). CAPM is a fundamental concept in finance that describes the relationship between expected returns and the risk associated with a security.
1. Stock Beta Calculation: Measure a stock's volatility relative to the overall market.
2. Expected Return (CAPM): Estimate the expected return of each stock based on its risk.
3. Portfolio Analysis: Calculate the weighted beta for a portfolio of multiple stocks.
4. Interactive Visualizations: Use data visualization techniques to explore trends and stock correlations.
